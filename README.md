# Password-Generator-
My first password generator using JS

The purpose of this challenge is to pick up some starter code which has completed HTML, CSS files and a part completed JavaScript code and to create an online password generator. I am going to try complete the functions within the JS file to generate password between 10-64 characters using uppercase, lowercase and special character as well as numbers.

First I will complete the function of getting the password options from the user which means I will need to prompt the user to advise which options to use. I will also need to ask what length the user wants the password to be.

The purpose of this password generator is to be able to provide the user with random passwords as and when the user requires a password which means I will require a function which allows the password generator to create random passwords more than once. My purpose is to complete the getRandom function to use the provided arrays in random each time the user uses this site.
