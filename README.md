# Password-Generator-
My first password generator using JS

The purpose of this challenge is to pick up some starter code which has completed HTML, CSS files and a part completed JS code and to create an online password generator. I am going to try complete the functions within the JS file to generate password between 10-64 characters using uppercase, lowercase and special character as well as numbers.
